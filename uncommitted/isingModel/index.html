					<p>Today we will discuss the Monte Carlo method, wich has a myriad of applications in fields like physics, economy, biology, and many others and plays a key role in many modern researches. Our discussion will be centered in the first relevant use of the Monte Carlo method in physics, the Ising model.</p>
					<p>The Monte Carlo method consist in making several random runs of a algorithm in order to obtain representative trajectories to approximate the mean behaviour of a given system.</p>
					<p>The average of a discrete (for simplicity) quantity $Q$ over the set of all possible configurations \(\mu\) can be written as $$<Q>=\frac{\sum_{\mu} Q_{\mu} P(Q_{\mu})}{\sum{\mu} P(Q_{\mu}).}$$ We can then estimate this quantity using a subset M: $$Q_M = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^M Q_{i} P(Q_{i})}{\sum{i=0}^M P(Q_{i}).}$$. Our task is then to find a way to find this set M for which $Q_M \sim <Q>. This is not an easy task in most cases, but we can start with some simple examples.</p> 
				<p>The first usages of this method where in numerical analysis, whete we seek to find a quantity such as the value of a intergral or the area of a region (for a mathematical background in these aplications see and referecens therein). Lets consider the task of finding the area of a circle. If wew pick say 100 points in a square containing this circle, its reasonable to think that the overall percentage of points inside the circle correspond to the percentage of area that the circle occupies in the squre. In this case just picking a number of random points is a valid and sufficient method to estimate the quantity we want. Generaly implementing this example is the first exercise left for the interested reader, luckly we are not in a calculus book. Since we know exactly how to find the area of a circle, we could instead use the result to estimate the value of \(\pi\).</p> 
				<p>One could study how our precision increases as we increse the total number of points and if our result indeed converges to the true value of \(\pi\).</p>
				<p>Now lets tackle our main task,m study the Ising model. This is a model about the structure of the spins in a magnetic material. It can be defined in a square lattice, where each site has a spin $\sigma_i = \pm 1$. The nergy of the whole lattice can be modeled considerin first naighbor interations via a field \(\mathcal{J}\) and the interation of each site with an external field \(\mathcal{H}\), wich gives us the Ising Hamiltonian $$ \mathcal{H} = \sum_{(ij)} \mathcal{J}_{ij} \sigma_i \simga_j$$ + \sum_i H_i \sigma_i. For simplicity we will consider a homogenous case where the fields $\mathcal{J}_{ij} = \mathcal{J} and $H_i = H$ don't depend on the position.</p>
				<p>If we just pick random values for each spin we will allways get a configuration where aprroxmately half the spins ar "up" and the other half is "down", wich is obviously not the case for different values of the fields and temperature of the lattice (e.g. a strong external field would easily align all spins in its direction). So how we find configurations that correspond to the physical properties of the system? The "brute force" aproach comes to mind where we just compute ALL the possible configurations and pick the ones that interest us, but if we pick, for example, a 10x10x10 lattice it would have \(2^{1000}\approx 10^{300}\) possible configurations. For comparison the estimated number of Plank valumes in the universe is approximately \(10^{186}\).</p>
				<p>To find the subset \(M\) of configurations that will allow us to correctly find the properties of the system, we must stablish how we are going to generate each individual configurations. This problem was aproachd by ..., and we will follow their rationale. A intuitive way is to stablish a dynamic between each configuration and let the system evolve under a set of rules. This dynamic must created to ensure some key things:
				<ul>
					<li>Achieve themal equilibrium in a finite number of steps</li>
					<li>Have the adquate probability distribuition between states</li>
					<li>Keep ergodity (all states should be achievable in a finite number of steps at any given time)</li>
				</ul>
				</p> 
				<p>We turn to nature to provide us some insights: In equilibrium the energy o a system limmits itself to a small range of values and big, abrupt, fluctuations in the energy are highly improbable. To simulate this we can consider a dynamic (between configurations) where at each step we one change a single spin at a time. Stochastic systems (i.e. systems with random "elements" such as random forces or, in our case, random fluctuations) is governed by a master equation (see Mario for a deeper discussion on this topoic). Such equation is basicaly a continuty equation of probabilities, stating that the local chance in probability is all the probabilities that "entered" the state minus the probability that "left" the state.</p>
