			This blog was created to be a shared page where all the students in my university could write about their projects and share then with the community. I donated the source code to the institutes hackerspace so they could curate it, and now I use it in my git to publish some of my favorite projects. It's mainly used as a personal notebook where I write about my own studies, but I hope they will be of some use to someone else as well. With the exception of bootstrap, everything here was build from scratch, so if you find some bug or have some criticism please let me know!
